# Installation:
## Setting up the virtual enviorment:
Install any text editor that allows to create a terminal. We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for this demonstration.
Open the program, and create a terminal. On the terminal, we'll create a Virtual Envoirment by typing: "py -m virtenv (name of the enviorment)". Once that's done, we'll do a
"../(name of the enviorment)/Scripts/activate" to start the enviorment.
## Installing dependencies:
Now, we'll install the dependencies. We need:
- flask_bootstrap
- flask_login
- flask_sqlalchemy
- flask_migrate
- werkzeug
We'll do a "pip install" for each of those dependencies.

After that, we're done installing!

# Executing the page:
To do that, we'll set up the Virtual Enviorment, as shown in "Setting up the virtual enviorment".
Afterwards, we enter the "app" folder with "cd app" and we execute the python file by doing "py app.py", and you're done!
